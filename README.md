# club-site
https://club-site-main.herokuapp.com/

This site uses React, Nodejs, MondoDB and Express and for now some bootstrap. It also uses the stripe API for subscription payments and nodemailer. 
I intead to use GSAP in the future to take the design to the next level and authentication (Auth0, JWt or Passport) 

## Plan
At the end of the build for this site should allow for customers to make a subscription to service, I am using the stripe API for this. 
They should also be able to sign up, which will make a POST request to the database. The agent would have a seperate section which will be authenticated. 
I am still deciding on which technology to use. The agent will be able to use CRUD operation, whith the customers data.

## To do
Authentication
Automatic Email when user has signed up, which stated that the agent will get in touch with them
Functionality that allows agents to send an email template automatically
GSAP
