# club-site

This site uses React, Nodejs, MondoDB and Express. It also uses the stripe API, nodemailer, authentication (Auth0, JWt or Passport) and for now some bootstrap. 
Intead to use GSAP in the future to take the design to the next level.

## Plan
At the end of the build for this site should allow for customers to make a subscription to service, I am using the stripe API for this. 
They should also be able to sign up, which will make a POST request to the database. The agent would have a seperate section which will be authentoicated. 
I am still deciding on which technology to use. The agent will be able to use CRUD operation, whith the customers data.
